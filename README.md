## Description

This project was interesting for a few reasons, I had to learn how to connect my javascript code to a mysql database and how to run mysql code in javascript. It also taught me a few lessons on asynchronous functions and how to handle data between them. I believe you could take a few lessons from this challange and apply them to real world applications with different databases.

You can use this to keep a database of employees, their roles, departments, salaries and managers. It allows you to keep this data lightweight and dynamic and easy to change.
